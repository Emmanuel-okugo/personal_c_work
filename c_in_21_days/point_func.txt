1. float (*p)(int R);
p = average;


2. int (*p[10])(char *);

3. char *p[10];

4. in my own understanding that is an error due to type incompatibility
	x is of (x *[12])
	ptr is of (ptr *)

5. 	struct record
	{
		char *name;
		int Age;
		int phone number[11];
		char *state;
		struct record *next = NULL;
	}credentials;
