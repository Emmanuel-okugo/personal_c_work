aim:  write a program that computes the number of each character from a to z in a file

#This is a version of the occurance program 
- this one opens a file and reads each line from it
- the other uses redirection to read the file from stdin
- this one is more organized and prompts the tells the user the correct way to run the code
- the other doesn't, when redirection isn't used, problem occurs

*this program uses the delay fuucntion from the parent directory
