Chapter one 
1.0 Quantum dots technology 
1.1  what is a quantum dot quantum dots or semiconductor nano-crystals are three dimensional materials with size below 100nm. According to Wikipedia, they are semiconductor particles a few nanometers in size  with optical and electronic properties that differ from those of larger particles via quantum mechanical effects. 
Quantum dots are typically made of elements from groups II-VI or III-V of the periodic table, such as cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium sulfide (CdS), or indium arsenide (InAs). These materials are chosen for their unique quantum mechanical properties, which allow them to emit light when excited by energy sources such as ultraviolet light or an electrical current. The size of a quantum dot is typically on the order of a few nanometers, which is why they exhibit quantum effects. 
1.2  How They Are Produced  
Quantum dots are synthesized via colloidal synthesis. Precursors containing desired elements are dissolved in a solvent, then injected into a heated solution with a reducing agent. Nucleation and growth occur, forming nano crystals. Surface passivation stabilizes them. Purification removes impurities, and the quantum dots are characterized. Parameters like temperature and precursor concentration are adjusted to control size and properties. This process yields nano scale semiconductor particles with tunable optical and electronic characteristics, crucial for applications in displays, solar cells, and biomedical imaging. 
Other production method includes: 
•	Plasma synthesis 
•	High temperature dual injection 
•	Fabrication 
1.3 Applications 
 Quantum dot is a very important technology in modern day electronics because they are used in displays(monitors), lighting, photo detectors, quantum computing and so may aspects of electronics. 
“ Quantum dots, with high extinction coefficients and ultrafast optical nonlinearities, are promising for optical applications and quantum information processing. Their size-tunable properties allow larger dots to shift toward red light with less quantum behavior, while smaller dots exhibit more quantum effects. Quantum dots enhance optical and transport properties due to their zero-dimensional structure. They are used in diode lasers, amplifiers, and biological sensors. Excitation by gold nanoparticles enhances their photoluminescence, making them ideal for optical encoding, cellular imaging, and diagnostics. CdSe nanocrystals serve as triplet photosensitizers, applicable in photodynamic therapy, photovoltaic devices, and molecular electronics. ” – wikepedia 
Quantum dots has many applications but are broadly used in display production, increasing their resolutions, colour accuracy  and so on. 
An online source named XTPL stated “QD display offer much brighter representation, improved gamma and contrast  that is not attainable in the older IPS/LCD technology. The advantages come from the difference in the way the display being projected from the screen when comparing to the legacy LCD technology ” . This means more accurate colours, high contrast, brightness efficiency, energy efficiency, quick response time and right viewing angles and all displays. 
Another significant application of quantum dots is  in quantum computing. Quantum computing is the production of computers that perform complex calculations which a normal computer cannot perform using quantum bits (qubit), Though this is not a popular technology and has not been  produced massively but  it should be. 
quantum dots represent a revolutionary advancement in semiconductor technology, offering significant improvements in color accuracy, brightness, and energy efficiency for displays, and enhancing capabilities in quantum computing, photodetection, and biomedical imaging. Their unique quantum mechanical properties and tunable characteristics make them a pivotal technology for the future of electronics, promising continued innovation and application across various fields. As research and development progress, the impact of quantum dots is expected to expand, driving advancements in both consumer electronics and cutting-edge scientific applications.

2.0  3D INTEGRATION 
2.1 meaning of 3d integration 
In the world of semiconductors and microelectronics, a trend to vertically stack integrated circuits (ICs) or circuitry has emerged as a viable solution for meeting electronic device requirements such as higher performance, increased functionality, lower power consumption, and a smaller footprint. The various methods and processes used to achieve this are called 3D integration technologies. 
According to Wikipedia A three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) is a MOS (metal-oxide semiconductor) integrated circuit (IC) manufactured by stacking as many as 16 or more ICs and interconnecting them vertically using, for instance, through-silicon vias (TSVs) or Cu-Cu connections, so that they behave as a single device to achieve performance improvements at reduced power and smaller footprint than conventional two dimensional processes. 
2.2 Types  
3D ICs can be divided into 3D Stacked ICs (3D SIC), which refers to advance packaging techniques stacking IC chips using TSV interconnects, and monolithic 3D ICs, which use fab processes to realize 3D interconnects at the local levels of the on-chip wiring hierarchy as set forth by the ITRS, this results in direct vertical interconnects between device layers. The first examples of a monolithic approach are seen in Samsung's 3D V-NAND devices.  As of the 2010s, 3D IC packages are widely used for NAND flash memory in mobile devices. 
2.3 production 
There are various methods for designing 3D ICs, with wafer bonding being a prominent technique alongside recrystallization. Wafer bonding encompasses two primary types: Cu-Cu connections, involving copper-to-copper links within stacked ICs, often utilized in Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs), and TSV-based connections. In TSV-based 3D ICs, solder microbumps, small solder balls, act as interfaces between individual dies.   
By 2014, several memory products, such as High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and the Hybrid Memory Cube, had been introduced, employing 3D IC stacking with TSVs. Various stacking approaches are being implemented and explored, including die-to-die, die-to-wafer, and wafer-to-wafer configurations. 
2.3.1 Die-to-die: In die-to-die stacking, electronic components are constructed on separate dies, which are then aligned and bonded together. Thinning and TSV creation may occur before or after bonding. A significant advantage is that each component die can be individually tested, preventing a single faulty die from compromising the entire stack. Additionally, binning allows for the optimization of power consumption and performance by selectively combining dice from different process corners. 
2.3.2 Die-to-wafers: Die-to-wafer stacking involves building electronic components on two semiconductor wafers. One wafer is diced, and the resulting dice are aligned and bonded onto designated sites on the second wafer. Thinning and TSV creation can occur before or after bonding, and additional dice may be added to the stack before dicing. 
2.3.3 Wafers-to-wafers: Wafer-to-wafer stacking entails building electronic components on two or more semiconductor wafers, aligning and bonding them, and then dicing them into 3D ICs. Thinning may occur before or after bonding, and vertical connections, known as through-silicon vias (TSVs), can be incorporated into the wafers before bonding or created within the stack afterward. However, wafer-to-wafer bonding can reduce yields since the failure of any chip in the stack renders the entire IC defective. Additionally, wafers must be of the same size, posing a challenge for integrating exotic materials manufactured on smaller wafers into CMOS logic or DRAM processes typically utilizing larger 300 mm wafers. 
2.4 Applications and Benefits 
Traditional CMOS scaling improves signal speed but is becoming harder and more expensive due to power-density limits and slow interconnects. 3D ICs solve this by stacking 2D dies and connecting them vertically, speeding up communication between layers. Key benefits of 3D ICs include: 
2.4.1 Footprint: More functionality in a smaller space, allowing for smaller, more powerful devices. 
2.4.2 Cost: Breaking a large chip into smaller dies and stacking them can improve yield and reduce costs, especially with separate die testing. 
2.4.3 Heterogeneous Integration: Different layers can use different processes, optimizing components better and combining incompatible technologies. 
2.4.5 Shorter Interconnect: Reduces wire length by about 10–15%, potentially improving circuit delay despite higher capacitance. 
2.4.6 Power: Reduces power consumption by 10–100 times, lowering heat and extending battery life. 
2.4.7 Design: Adds more connectivity options and new design possibilities. 
2.4.8 Security: Makes reverse engineering harder and protects against attacks with dedicated security layers. 
2.4.9 Bandwidth: Allows for wider buses between layers, easing memory access issues. 
3D integration, through various stacking methods, enhances IC performance, reduces power consumption, and optimizes design, offering significant advantages in footprint, cost, heterogeneous integration, and security.

4.0 Gat-All-around(GAA) transistors 
4.1 What is a GAA transistor? 
According to Wikipedia, GAAFET, also known as a surrounding-gate transistor (SGT), is similar in concept to a FinFET except that the gate material surrounds the channel region on all sides. Depending on design, gate-all-around FETs can have two or four effective gates. Gateall-around FETs have been successfully characterized both theoretically and experimentally. They have also been successfully etched onto nanowires of InGaAs, which have a higher electron mobility than silicon. 
A Gate-All-Around (GAA) MOSFET was first shown in 1988 by a Toshiba team including Fujio Masuoka, Hiroshi Takato, and Kazumasa Sunouchi. They demonstrated a vertical nanowire GAAFET, which they called a "surrounding gate transistor" (SGT). Fujio Masuoka, also known for inventing flash memory, later left Toshiba and founded Unisantis Electronics in 2004 to further research SGT technology with Tohoku University. 
In 2006, researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and 
Technology (KAIST) and the National Nano Fab Center created a 3 nm transistor, the world's smallest nanoelectronic device at that time, using GAA FinFET technology. 
GAAFET transistors can use high-k/metal gate materials. They can have up to 7 nanosheets, which improves performance and reduces size. The widths of these nanosheets can be adjusted to change the device's characteristics. 
By 2020, Samsung and Intel announced plans to start mass-producing GAAFET transistors (specifically MBCFET transistors). Meanwhile, TSMC decided to continue using FinFETs for their 3 nm node, even though they are also developing GAAFET transistors.
