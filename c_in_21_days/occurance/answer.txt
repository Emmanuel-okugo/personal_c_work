STRING COMPRESSION: String compression is a process of reducing the size of a
string by encoding it in a more compact representation while preserving its essential
information. This technique finds applications in various fields such as data storage,
data transmission, and information retrieval, where minimizing the storage or
transmission space is crucial. String compression algorithms aim to achieve efficient
encoding and decoding processes while ensuring that the original data can be
reconstructed accurately.
